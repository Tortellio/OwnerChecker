OwnerChecker is a plugin that makes an admins job 100x easier.

Look at a vehicle, barricade, or structure and do /checkowner to get the steam id, name, group, and profile of the player who built/locked it.

You can enable or disable features in the config file!

Command permission: checkowner

A lot of this code is from SDPlugins. Most of the credit should go to them. I just updated it, cleaned it up, and added a little more stuff!
